This is a script to convert test cases from excel/csv into XML so that they can be put into the QA test case management solution, TestRail.

This script depends on the lxml library to create the XML structure.

The Confluence page for how to run this script is here: https://fulcrumtech.atlassian.net/wiki/display/QAS/Importing+Test+Cases+into+TestRail
